## Prerequisites

* Python 3
* A clone of this repo
* A suitable dev environment, such as `VSCode`

## Getting Started

Create a new virtual environment:

```sh
# Windows
$ py -m venv venv

# MacOS/Unix
$ python3 -m venv venv
```

Activate the virtual environment:

```sh
# Windows
$ source venv/Scripts/activate

# MacOS/Unix
$ source venv/bin/activate

## The Task
